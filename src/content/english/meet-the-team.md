    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Our FTC Team, BRB Robotics, 26502, started in 2024 with the support of Blue Ridge Boost. Our goal is to expand both our team and FIRST by educating and engaging with our community through demonstrations. Through these events, we hope to connect with potential teammates and sponsors who can help support our efforts.</p>
